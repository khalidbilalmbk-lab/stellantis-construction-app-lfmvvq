### Issue: "No package name found"
**Solution:** Make sure `app.json` has `android.package` set to `com.stellantis.construction`

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Solution:** Check the build logs in your Expo dashboard for specific errors

### Issue: "Credentials not found"
**Solution:** Run `eas credentials` to set up signing credentials

## After Your App is Live

### Push Updates Without App Store Review:

```bash
eas update --branch production --message "Updated content"
```

This works for JavaScript changes only (UI updates, bug fixes, etc.)

### For Native Changes (New Features):

1. Update version in `app.json`:
   ```json
   "version": "1.0.1",
   "ios": { "buildNumber": "2" },
   "android": { "versionCode": 2 }
   ```

2. Build and submit again:

   eas build --platform all --profile production
   eas submit --platform all
   ```
